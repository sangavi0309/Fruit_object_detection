# Fruit_object_detection
This project focuses on building an intelligent Fruit Object Detection system using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. The model is trained to automatically detect and classify fruits such as apple, banana, and orange from images with high accuracy.  A YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model is used for real-time detection .
